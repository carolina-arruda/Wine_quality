# Wine_quality

In this report we use two datasets available at <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine'>UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>. These datasets contain information of red and white variantes of the portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167923609001377'>[2]</a>. There are 12 columns corresponding to physicochemical and sensory variables.

The main goals of this report are:

      i) explore data;
     ii) create a machine learning model to predict if the wine is red or white;
    iii) create a machine learning model to predict the wine quality.
